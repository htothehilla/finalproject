I took part in intro to python with code first girls.

My final project was to develop python script that would produce results from a recipe food api search by a user.
The results are prodcued in a text file (results.txt).

For more information on the API please see here:https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api

To note I have changed the paramaters for it to be only vegan food.

I am currently looking at ways to better improve the fuctionality of the python script. I would like to use it for my everyday life.
